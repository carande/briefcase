## 
My interest is to develop and operate technology for space systems, and to advance our understanding of the Earth.
I am a generalist with a wide background in physical sciences, software engineering, and remote sensing.

My recent focus has been been microservice software systems and satellite mission analysis workflows.  I value working on high-performing teams, and I am comfortable with roles from troubleshooting and writing code, to making technical and strategic design decisions, to coordinating tasks and providing team leadership.  


## Experience

**Principal Systems Software Engineer**
  : **BAE Systems**
  : **Aug 2025 - Present**

- Determined system requirements and developed a Kubernetes-based test infrastructure for measuring mission-specific algorithm performance (ie tracking algorithms)
- Technical lead on newly formed infrastructure team; identified knowledge gaps and provided team training and mentorship
- Identified and documented best practices for a mission analysis toolset, filling a gap in training materials available for new analysts

**Staff R&D Scientist**
  : **Maxar Technologies**
  : **Jan 2019 - May 2025**

- Analyzed performance of the Constellation Scheduling System for Worldview operations
- Assessed impacts of operational changes to satellites (GNC degredation, orbit changes, etc)
- Implemented a python-based analytics toolset to load, process, and visualize data across several domains.
- Orchestrated system tests using synthetic data to measure the effect of software and parameter changes.
- Lead developer and product owner for an internal-use GUI to show potential imaging opportunities for a location.


**Software Engineer**
  : **DigitalGlobe / Maxar Technologies**
  : **Jun 2016 - Jan 2019**

- Engineer for an Agile-Scrum software team in the mission planning (tasking) domain
- Responsible for design, dev, deployment, and support of microservices in Java and Python, as well as GUIs
- Learned and utilized our common CI/CD infrastructure stack (GitHub, Artifactory, Jenkins, Kubernetes, AWS)


**Software Engineer**
  : **GroupHigh**
  : **Nov 2014 - May 2016**

- Full-stack development of a web application for a blog intelligence platform
- Contributed to user-facing front end (Angular) as well as distributed big-data processing back end (Java, Hadoop, Solr)
- Implemented a system health monitor for on-prem server cluster proactively tracking hardware health, system compute
resources, automated processes, and job throughput.


**Geophysical Software Developer**
  : **MagVAR**
  : **Apr 2014 - Oct 2014**

- Wrote software to automate data processing and analysis of wellbore measurements, airborne magnetic surveys, and global magnetic observatory data.
