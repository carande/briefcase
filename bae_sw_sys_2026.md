## Professional Summary
My interest is to develop new technology for space systems, and to advance our understanding of the Earth.  
I am a technical leader with 10+ years experience on software development teams, and a broad background in physical sciences, data engineering, and satellite remote sensing.

I value working on high-performing teams, and I provide leadership to move projects forward.  I have deep experience with the Agile development process, and am comfortable leading code reviews, scrum meetings, quarterly planning, technical demos, and team retros.  

My technical involvement has spanned the software dev-ops lifecycle process, from prototyping algorithms, to microservice design and deployment, to proactive system monitoring and operational incident analysis.  I have experience with product ownership of internal-use software tools and GUIs, including soliciting customer feedback, feature planning and prioritization, and fostering cross-team collaboration.
